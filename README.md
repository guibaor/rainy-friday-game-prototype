# Rainy Friday game prototype
It is 5p.m. on a rainy Friday. After a long day in class, Frankie must do some tasks on the way home.  
 
In this adventure PC game for all audiences, you'll explore the city under the calm sound of the rain and the warm reflection of the streetlights, meanwhile joking with the neighbours, reflecting on the student's life and completing short missions through different minigames.

This game was created in scope of the Game Development subject (Masarykova Univerzita, Brno). The idea was to design and implement a videogame from scratch, with little to no previous knwoledge of Unity and game development.
